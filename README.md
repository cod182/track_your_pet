# TrackYourPet

TrackYourPet is a user-friendly, low-tech solution for finding your lost pets. With no subscription fees and no need for a battery-powered tracker, it relies on a simple QR code that links to your pet's own profile page. When the QR code is scanned, you receive alerts about your pet's location.
